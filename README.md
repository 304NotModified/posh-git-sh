hsop-git
========

This my first venture into bash scripting, so I decided to make a port of posh-git, which, in my humble opinion, is
fantastic (and can be found at found at https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git).

I based my work off of https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh

This is distributed under the GNU GPL v2.0. I hope you find some use of it.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
========================
1. Copy this file to somewhere (e.g. ~/.git-prompt.sh).
2. Add the following line to your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`:
    > source ~/.git-prompt.sh
3. 
    a. Change your PS1 to call __git_ps1 as command-substitution:
    > Bash: PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ '
    > ZSH:  PS1='[%n@%m %c$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ '
        The optional argument will be used as the format string.
    b. Alternatively, if you are using bash, `__git_ps1` can be used for `PROMPT_COMMAND` with two parameters, `<pre>` 
    and `<post>`, which are strings you would put in $PS1 before and after the status string generated by the git-prompt
    machinery, e.g.,
        > PROMPT_COMMAND='__git_ps1 "\u@\h:\w" "\\\$ "'
    will show username, at-sign, host, colon, cwd, then various status strings, followed by dollar and SP, as your
    prompt. Optionally, you can supply a third argument with a printf format string to finetune the output of the branch
    status.


CONFIG OPTIONS
==============

This should work out of the box, but there are some options available.
