hsop-git
========

This my first venture into bash scripting, so I decided to make a port of posh-git, which, in my humble opinion, is
fantastic (and can be found at found at https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git).

I based my work off of https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh

This is distributed under the GNU GPL v2.0. I hope you find some use of it.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
========================
1. Copy this file to somewhere (e.g. ~/.git-prompt.sh).
2. Add the following line to your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`:

        source ~/.git-prompt.sh
3. a. Change your `PS1` to call `__git_ps1` by command-substitution:

    > Bash: `PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ '`
    
    > ZSH:  `PS1='[%n@%m %c$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ '`
    
    The optional argument is a format string.
    
    b. Alternatively, if you are using bash, `__git_ps1` can be used for `PROMPT_COMMAND` with two parameters, `<pre>` 
    and `<post>`, which are strings you would put in `$PS1` before and after the status string generated by the 
    git-prompt machinery. For example, the following
    
        PROMPT_COMMAND='__git_ps1 "\u@\h:\w" "\\\$ "'
        
    will show username, at-sign, host, colon, cwd, then various status strings, followed by dollar and space, as your
    prompt. Optionally, you can supply a third argument with a printf format string to fine-tune the output of the branch
    status.


CONFIG OPTIONS
==============

This should work out of the box, but there are some options available, mostly setting things in the local git config for 
per-repository options.
```
bash.enableFileStatus
bash.enableGitStatus
bash.showStatusWhenZero
bash.showUpstream
```

bash.enableFileStatus
---------------------

    * true      Default. The script will query for all file indicators every time.
    * false     No file indicators will be displayed. The script will not query upstream for differences. Branch color-
                coding information is still displayed.

bash.enableGitStatus
--------------------
    
    * true      Default. Color coding and indicators will be shown.
    * false     The script will not run.

bash.showStatusWhenZero
-----------------------
    
    * false     Default. No file change indicators will be shown if there are no changes to the index or working tree
    * true      Indicators will be shown even if there are no updates to the index or working tree

bash.showUpstream
-----------------
By default, `__git_ps1` will compare `HEAD` to your `SVN` upstream if it can find one, or `@{upstream}` otherwise.

    * legacy    don't use the '--count' option available in recent versions of git-rev-list
    * git       always compare HEAD to @{upstream}
    * svn       always compare HEAD to your SVN upstream
